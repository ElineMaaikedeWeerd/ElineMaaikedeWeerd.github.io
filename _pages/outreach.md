title: "Teaching & Outreach"

Being able to communicate science to both students and general public is, in my opinion, a privilege, as well as our duty as scientists. I started mentoring undergraduate students while I was an undergrad at the University of Edinburgh myself, being involved in various peer-assisted learning schemes as both a tutor and peer support leader, for which I received an Edinburgh Award.


During my PhD I have been a teaching assistant and marker for the modules *Nuclear Physics & Astrophysics* (a second year nuclear physics course), *Our Universe* (a first year astronomy course), and *Mathematical Techniques 1* (a first year mathematics for physics course). I have also helped supervise two MSc project students, in 2018 and 2019 respectively, primarily providing hands-on support with Python, codes such as CLASS and CAMB, as well as helping understand concepts within relativistic effects and the galaxy bispectrum. 

### IAU100 Women and Girls in Astronomy initiative

In 2019, I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in outreach in the [Astro Molo Mhlaba](https://www.astromolomhlaba.org/) project, an initiative in Khayelitsha (Cape Town, South Africa) which aims to target the issues of inclusivity and diversity in STEM in South Africa by engaging the most underrepresented group (black girls from underserved communities). The event won the [IAU100 Women and Girls in Astronomy events competition](https://www.iau-100.org/astro-molo-mhalaba). 

### Introduction to Programming summer course

Between finishing my undergraduate degree and starting my PhD, I independently organised and ran a 5-day summer school for a group of students in their final years of primary school. I strongly believe programming, like any other language, is most easily picked up at a younger age, and taught basic programming (Arduino) using educational robots.
