Welcome on my personal webpage!

I'm a theoretical physicist currently residing in Lyon, France. I obtained my PhD in February 2022 from [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/astro/), London, UK, where I worked (primarily) on relativistic effects and the galaxy bispectrum under supervision of Dr Chris Clarkson. My PhD involved extensive analytical and numerical analysis of the galaxy bispectrum; a statistical measure which will be an important probe in upcoming cosmological surveys. We published 5 papers in peer-reviewed journals, which can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1751813). 
In addition to my research, I worked as a teaching assistant, teaching undergraduate classes on nuclear physics, astrophysics, and mathematics. I also hosted telescope demonstrations at the university's telescope, and outreach I participated in during my extended research visit to Cape Town won the prestigious International Astronomy Union's [IAU100 Women and Girls in Astronomy prize](https://www.iau-100.org/astro-molo-mhalaba). 

Before starting my PhD in September 2017, I completed a degree in Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh (2012-2017), of which I spent the third year abroad under an ERASMUS scholarship at Uppsala Universitet, Sweden. I'm originally from Lelystad, The Netherlands.

In my spare time I enjoy [running and cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/38993823), art, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27242605-eline).
