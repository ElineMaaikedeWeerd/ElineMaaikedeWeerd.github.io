I'm a PhD student in the Cosmology and Relativity group at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/astro/). My primary research interests are in theoretical aspects of large scale structure, relativistic effects, and the galaxy bispectrum. In addition to this I'm interested in detectability of these relativistic signatures in future surveys, parameter forecasts and Fisher matrix techniques. 

Before starting my PhD in September 2017, I completed an undergraduate degree in Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh (2012-2017), of which I spent the third year at Uppsala Universitet, Sweden. I'm originally from Lelystad, The Netherlands.
