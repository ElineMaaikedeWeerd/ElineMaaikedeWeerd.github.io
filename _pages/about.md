I'm a PhD student in the Cosmology and Relativity group at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/astro/), where I work (primarily) on relativistic effects and the galaxy bispectrum under supervision of Dr. Chris Clarkson and Dr. Alkistis Pourtsidou. 

Before starting my PhD in September 2017, I completed a degree in Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh (2012-2017), of which I spent the third year abroad under an ERASMUS scholarship at Uppsala Universitat, Sweden. I'm originally from Lelystad, The Netherlands.

In my spare time I enjoy [running and cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/38993823), art, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27242605-eline).
