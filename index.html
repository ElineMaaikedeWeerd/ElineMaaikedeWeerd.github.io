<p>Hi, welcome on my personal webpage! I'm a theoretical physicist. I obtained a PhD from Queen Mary, University of London, UK in 2022, where I worked on relativistic corrections to the galaxy bispectrum. Before that, I completed a Master's degree in Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. </p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://emdeweerd.com/contact/">contact me</a> about any aspect of my work or otherwise.</p>
